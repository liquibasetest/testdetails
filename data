Previously, we had successfully raised a ticket to create multiple external databases, and the S Team graciously assisted in the process. However, our current situation presents a challenge as we are unable to obtain API access and the Hassium Admin is unavailable for our application. Despite our efforts, the required Hassium group remains unavailable.

With a looming delivery deadline approaching rapidly, we find ourselves in a critical situation where timely action is imperative to avoid project delays. In light of this, we kindly request the assistance of the SRE team in creating the database ENV_SAP_LOB_EXT_DB.

Your support in this matter is highly appreciated, and it will greatly contribute to ensuring the seamless progression of our project within the specified timelines.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent request. Should you require any further information or clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out.
