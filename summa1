Yes, that's correct. When you issue a SELECT statement on a Snowflake external table with a partition defined using a derived column from the metadata$filename, Snowflake considers the virtual partition that is dynamically generated based on the metadata during query execution. It doesn't directly consider or rely on the actual values stored in the S3 paths for querying; instead, it dynamically interprets the partition based on the metadata.
