Immuta leverages metadata and tags to enforce data governance policies in a tag-driven manner.


Certainly, here's a concise bullet-point summary:

Snowflake (Immuta Policy Enforcement):
Native Integration:

Immuta enforces policies natively within the Snowflake environment.
User AD groups are not tied to specific platforms; policies are seamlessly applied in Snowflake.
Flexibility:

Users' AD groups are not platform-specific, offering flexibility in policy application.
Policies are enforced directly within Snowflake without the need for additional dependencies.
Policy Consistency:

Same subscription policies and data policies are pushed to Snowflake, ensuring consistent enforcement.
Redshift (Immuta Policy Enforcement):
Enforcement in Spectrum:

Immuta enforces policies by creating views in the Redshift Spectrum layer.
Policies are applied to the data queried through Spectrum, providing a layer of abstraction.
Centralized Policy Management:

Immuta centrally manages policies, pushing them to Redshift Spectrum for enforcement.
Users can interact with data through views, ensuring policy adherence.
Dynamic View Creation:

Policies translate into dynamic view creation in the Redshift Spectrum environment.
Data access controls and dynamic data masking are applied through these views.
