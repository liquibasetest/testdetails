We are in the process of constructing the TAS Analytics Platform within Snowflake to access BUDE, SCE, and AE data through the Snowflake cloud platform (equivalent to IDWS1). For the presentation of second-party data, we have organized the information into separate schemas, categorizing them by ABC area and product name. The proposed schema naming convention will be visible to users, and access to this data will be granted using the existing IDWS1 user role. We would appreciate your validation and welcome any thoughts or feedback you may have on this schema naming convention.
