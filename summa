I've looked into and gathered information about the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK). It's a feature that comes built-in with Splunk starting from version 7, and it offers a wide range of capabilities. If we're using a version of Splunk that is 7.0.0 or newer, we can make use of this feature.
I have an expectation that our Splunk version is equal to or higher than 7.0
I've come across a presentation that showcases the implementation of the Splunk MLTK toolkit within our organization. This presentation confirms that they have implemented it using versions 7.x exclusively. I will be scheduling a meeting with some colleagues to gather more information, and I'll provide you with further details afterwards.
