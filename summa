As we proceed with the onboarding process to Snowflake, we have encountered a query regarding the Snowflake Immuta integration, specifically in relation to external tables.

During our discussions with the Snowflake team, we learned that external tables are accessed through the _EXT_DB database, and there is a designated role, DEV_Sealid_EXT_DATA_ENGINEER_FR. Our standard database is DEV_Soul_DB, while the external database is identified as DEV_Soul_FRDC_EXT_DB.

As part of the Snowflake Immuta integration guidelines, we have been instructed to grant the role DEV_1111_DATA_ENGINEER_FR to facilitate Snowflake's access to the Snowflake schema and tables. However, we have noticed that the specified role for external tables is DEV_Soul_FRDC_EXT_DB.

In light of this, we seek clarification on whether the Snowflake Immuta integration fully supports external tables and if any adjustments are required in terms of roles and permissions to ensure a smooth integration for both internal and external table
