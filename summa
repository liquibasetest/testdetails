Hello JJ, as we talked about, one of our use cases for migrating to Snowflake involves linking S3 files exposed as external tables in Snowflake with CBC tables. Could you kindly provide details or examples of S3 files/Athena tables and CBC tables that need to be linked to achieve the desired results? This information would greatly assist in conducting a proof of concept for the data sharing feature in Snowflake between our account and CBC account. Thank you
