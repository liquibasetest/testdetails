We have scheduled the migration of our on-premises application to the cloud, with the first phase set for implementation in Q4-2023. This initial phase will focus on minor aspects, while the complete migration is slated for the following year. In line with the established guidelines, we have completed the documentation required for provisioning the production account. The next steps involve obtaining ISM (Information Security Management) approval and seeking the necessary cloud ISM approval to proceed with the migration process.
