If you have defined an S3 Access Point policy that includes a specific "prefix" (logical path or folder) and you later delete that folder, the S3 Access Point policy will still remain as is. However, the policy's effectiveness and applicability will change based on the existing objects and their keys (paths) within the bucket.
