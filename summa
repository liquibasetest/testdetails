Yes, to fully leverage the capabilities of AWS Lake Formation, you need to register the S3 bucket location in Lake Formation. Registering an S3 bucket in Lake Formation's data lake location is a crucial step to enable centralized management and governance of data access and permissions for the data stored in that bucket.

When you register an S3 bucket in Lake Formation, it allows Lake Formation to integrate with the AWS Glue Data Catalog and track the metadata of the data stored in that bucket. The Glue Data Catalog acts as a central repository for storing schema and metadata information about the data in the data lake.

On the producer side:

Register S3 buckets in Lake Formation within the Data Lake location.
Create the LF tag.
Establish the database or table and assign the LF tag to the database. If LF tags are not assigned to tables or columns, they will inherit the tag from the database. Additionally, there is an option to include extra LF tags or override the existing ones.
Grant from the producer side:
4. Provide the LF tag details for use in the consumer account.

Grant the LF tag to the consumer account, offering the advantage of making all tags associated with the database, table, or column available on the consumer side with just one grant. Lines 3 and 4 in the diagram facilitate permission grants based on this setup.
Consumer side:
5. Once the LF tag details are shared, the consumer account's RAM will accept the shared invitation.

Create a resource link specifically for the database on the target side.
By leveraging this resource link, users can query the Athena table on the consumer side and access the data stored in the S3 bucket.
