An in-depth exploration of Immuta's capabilities for managing and governing data access in complex environments, such as multi-cloud or hybrid cloud setups, has been conducted. The features, including fine-grained access control, data masking, auditing, and policy enforcement, were thoroughly examined. A successful proof of concept for third-party data (a, b, c) demonstrated the adept implementation of fine-grained access control with Immuta across various cloud platforms, like Redshift and Snowflake, specifically in conjunction with external tables. This presentation took place within the C-FR Line of Business and was delivered during the ELT meeting.
