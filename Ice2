After our meeting with Xi, the following outcomes were identified:

Production Approval and Notification to XIA1:

XIA1 needs to be informed about the production approval.
Prior to this, approval from BAL on the required credit in production is essential.
I've scheduled a meeting with XIA1 on Monday morning to seek approval. Can we anticipate obtaining the necessary approvals?
Production Onboarding Checklist Update:

The production onboarding checklist needs to be updated.
This involves creating a few Confluence pages with detailed use cases.
I commit to filling in these details before Monday.
Please let me know if there are any additional points or adjustments needed.
