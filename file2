I had the privilege of collaborating with Ruma on the Redshift Spectrum Proof of Concept. As I was new to the Atlas Terraform setup, Ruma played a pivotal role in providing guidance on the Atlas configuration and shared her insights regarding certain errors. Currently, she is actively involved in the Proof of Concept focused on Redshift Spectrum consumption. Her ability to quickly grasp the setup and her ongoing contributions to this project have been invaluable. Ruma also played a crucial role in facilitating the approval process for the tickets required to carry out the Immuta Proof of Concept.
