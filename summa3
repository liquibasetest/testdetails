According to our intended approach, we're looking to utilize object tags in Amazon S3 (where the model serves as the key and the model ID as the value) for accessing specific S3 objects, thereby reaching the desired model. This approach is well-suited for fulfilling CADS requests from different AWS Accounts. However, we anticipate a potential need to create a storage integration in Snowflake in the future, should Snowflake require access to these external tables or utilize the object tags. Currently, CADS is instrumental in setting up the Snowflake storage integration. I can provide a sample request if needed. Notably, while Snowflake's documentation indicates support for specifying S3 buckets and prefixes in storage integration, it does not yet support configuring it based on object tags.
