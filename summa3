I'd like to inform you that Nishat and Jagdish assigned me the task of analyzing both the model and the features derived from it. I've explored several options, outlining the advantages and disadvantages of each. It appears that there have been subsequent discussions on this matter, although I was not included. You'll find my analysis on this page, and I'm open to providing further assistance if needed.
