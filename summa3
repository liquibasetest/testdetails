Fine-Grain Access Control:
Fine-grain access control involves granting precise permissions and access rights at a granular level within the database. Each user or role may have very specific privileges, allowing or restricting actions down to a fine level of detail.

Example - Fine-Grain Access Control:

User A can only read data from a specific table.
User B can insert, update, and delete records in a particular column of a table.
User C has access to a subset of rows within a table.
Coarse-Grain Access Control:
Coarse-grain access control involves providing more generalized access permissions. Users or roles might have broader privileges, covering larger portions of the database or even the entire database.

Example - Coarse-Grain Access Control:

A group of users has read and write access to an entire database.
All authenticated users can read data from a specific set of tables.
