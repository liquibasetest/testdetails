If my understanding of the problem statement is accurate, there was a previous issue where consumer AWS accounts had unrestricted access to both model output and model features. It's necessary to implement restrictions in this regard. Based on the email conversation, it seems that both model output and model features will be stored in the same table. While we can enforce access limitations for consumer users (particularly when using Athena or Redshift Spectrum) through column-level restrictions, the challenge arises when consumer AWS accounts access this folder via S3 access points, as both model output and model features become accessible in such scenarios.
