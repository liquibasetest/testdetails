When executing a "SELECT * FROM" query on an external table in Snowflake, an additional column named "VALUE" is displayed, containing the entire record. Following my discussion with the Snowflake integration team, they mentioned the capability to integrate with the "EXT_DB" field. I'm curious about how this field will be recognized or managed within Immuta


The suggestion to use metadata$external_table_partition would not suit our requirements, especially when we need to include columns from the file in our Snowflake external table. In our scenario, it's essential to add a partition based on the extracted date value from metadata$filename. While this approach provides the value as "partition_mon_yr=202203," we can further split and store the simplified value as "202203."
