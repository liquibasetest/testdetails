Our teams are actively involved in the GitHub Copilot POC and have collected diverse use cases from different teams. We would greatly appreciate it if you could share your team's specific use case.

Furthermore, we kindly request you to input the use cases into the dedicated Confluence page. Additionally, an expedited provision of the SIDs list would be highly appreciated.
