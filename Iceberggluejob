Our application is integrated with Snowflake, and a majority of our use cases depend on External tables that read S3 files from our AWS account. We've been investigating resiliency options in the event of disruptions in AWS or Snowflake VPS. It appears that there is currently no resiliency option provided for external tables, as mentioned on this page: [insert page link]. Could you please inform us if the JAS Team has plans to address this issue in their development pipeline? I've referenced information from this specific page, and I'm seeking further guidance.
